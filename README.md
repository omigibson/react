# Dashboard application

My name is Omi Gibba and I am a Front End Developer student at Medieinstitutet, Stockholm.

This is a simple dashboard application that I've built with React. The purpose of this exercise was to learn how to handle `state` and `props` in React.

The dashboard has five components:

1. It shows the currency exchange rate for EUR - CAD. Currency rates are fetched from https://fixer.io.
2. A timer that counts down from 5 minutes.
3. A clock that shows the current time.
4. A note where the user can store whatever text they like.
5. Information about todays weather in Stockholm, Sweden. The weather data is fetched from https://openweathermap.org/.
